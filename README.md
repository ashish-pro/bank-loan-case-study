# bank-loan-case-study
In this project, we conduct a case study on a community bank, examining its historical loan losses and loan quality rating matrix. 

We analyze the loan losses using the bank's internal quality rating system and present primary statistical findings. Additionally, we review current research on low latency across various system levels. Our project's discussions and conclusions may be valuable for banking and financial organizations that require critical latency for big data analytics.
When a loan application is received, the bank must assess the applicant's profile to decide on loan approval. This decision involves evaluating two types of risks.
If the loan applicant is likely to repay the loan, rejecting the loan application would result in a missed opportunity for the company. Conversely, if the applicant is unlikely to repay the loan, approving the loan could lead to a financial loss for the company.


When a client applies for a loan, there are four possible outcomes: the loan application is approved, canceled, refused, or the offer remains unused.
